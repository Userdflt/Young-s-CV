## **SUMMARY**
With a background in architecture and construction, I am now looking to pivot and delve deeper into the world of data, where my true passions lie.
My experience in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and attention to detail from the architectural discipline has equipped me with transferable skills
for data-driven roles. I recently completed my Data Science and AI certification with the Institute of Data (AUT Accredited), gaining hands-on experience in
Python, date analysis, machine learning, and AI (deep learning) techniques.

I am now looking to further develop my skills and secure a junior role within the data sector, where I can apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems
and drive business success.Using my skills in Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), SQL, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning,
I aim to make a positive contribution and continue growing in this exciting field.
