## **SUMMARY**

With a background in architecture and construction, I have transitioned into AI & Data Profession, applying problem-solving, analytical thinking, and attention to detail to data-driven and AI challenges. My ability to learn quickly and adapt allows me to bridge structured problem-solving from architecture with dynamic, real-world AI and machine learning applications.

I recently completed both the Data Science and AI Certification (AUT Accredited, Institute of Data) and the IBM Generative AI Engineering Professional Certificate, gaining expertise in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI), transformers, attention mechanisms, prompt engineering, and building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications.

### **What I Bring to the Table**
- **Analytical & Critical Thinking** ‚Äì Combining problem-solving and decision-making skills.  
- **Fast Learner & Adaptable** ‚Äì Quickly grasping complex concepts (both theoretical and practical).  
- **Creative Mindset** ‚Äì Merging analytical thinking with innovative approaches to tackle complex challenges.

I am actively seeking entry-level or junior opportunities in AI-related fields and machine learning, where I can apply my skills to solve real-world challenges and contribute to impactful projects. If you‚Äôre looking for a professional with technical expertise, creative problem-solving skills, and a fresh perspective, please contact.
